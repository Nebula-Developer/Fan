# FAN - Simply useful.
### What is it, and how do I get it?
FAN is an amazing tool used from Terminal / CMD that supplies things like HTML starter templates, opencmd, and alot more. (Still in development)

As of getting it, simply download the source code, and run the following two commands in Terminal (Linux/MacOS) or CMD (Windows)

gcc -o alias/Fan Fan.c<br>
gcc -o alias/fan Fan.c

<b>(Make sure you have GCC installed.)</b><br>
Then, simply run the installer correspondent to your operating system.

### Is it safe?
Check the source code, and check for yourself!
It is my first C program, and first time using the language. I am more experienced with C# and the fundamentals of web development, as of all my other projects.

So yes, it is all ok, and all safe. The only thing that could damage your pc is the installation, as it will set your PATH variable, but this is covered
with a backup being saved in your FAN installation if anything fails.
